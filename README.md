# Assessment 3: Research Repository

Create a research repository that includes:

a collection of your own codes
codes that you've been inspired by or practiced (with comments)
things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)

The following is the codes that was used to develop a help desk ticking system.

# My Code that I've been practiced
# Personal Assistance Code

This repository contains the code for a simple personal assistant that provides assistance to users in various areas, such as weather forecast, news updates and the potential to develop further for future use.

# Techonologies used

The code for this project was written in Python.  To build the processing functionality, I've used the pycharm, which is a free. I am still learning how to make use of some external APIs to provide weather forecasts and news updates.

# Features

This personal assistant can be used to perform several tasks such as: 

Fetching the current weather forecast
Fetching the latest news headlines

The assistant will greet you and ask you what you need help with.  You can then give it commands such as "What's the weather like?" and the assistant will execute the command and provide you with the appropriate information.

# Usage

To use this assistant, I need to have the API keys and tokens for accessing external services such as News, and OpenWeatherMap.  Once I have obtained the required credentials, I can create a '.env'file and add the credentials as environmental variables as below: 

WEATHER_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
NEWS_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'

Once these have set up the required credentials, I can run the script by typing the command.
